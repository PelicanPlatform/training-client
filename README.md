**Accompanying Slides**: [link TBD]

## Requirements

An internet connection and a web browser!

## Setup

For this tutorial, we recommend that you use a Guest [OSPool Notebook](https://portal.osg-htc.org/documentation/overview/test-drive-ospool/) as it satisfies the necessary requirements.
Abbreviated instructions are provided below.
Alternatively, follow the instructions in [Appendix: Manual Setup](#appendix-manual-setup) to setup a device of your choice.

### Log in to a Guest OSPool Notebook

Screenshots of this process are included in the Accompanying Slides.

1. Go to [notebook.ospool.osg-htc.org](https://notebook.ospool.osg-htc.org).
2. Click on the "Sign in with CILogon" button.
3. Select your identity provider and click the "Log On" button. *Note: "social" logins are not enabled!*
4. Sign in to your identity provider.
5. If given a choice of "Server Options", select "Guest Account: Explore OSPool Notebooks", then click the "Start" button.
6. Wait for server to start. Your browser should load a JupyterLab instance and display a "Launcher" tab.
7. Under the "Other" category, launch the "Terminal" tab.

## Quickstart

After completing the above setup, you're ready to download data using Pelican! 
First, follow the instructions below; we'll go into more detail later.

1. In a new browser, go to [osg-htc.org/services/osdf/data](http://osg-htc.org/services/osdf/data).
2. Choose an entry from the table of available repositories (a good default choice is the "RouteViews" repository).
3. Click on the row for the desired entry (but not on the button "View Datasets" or "Dataset Catalog" on the far right!).
4. In the pop-up window, look for the "Download a Public Object" section.
5. Copy the example command text shown under "With Pelican Client on the Command Line". The example command for the RouteViews repository is this:

   ```
   pelican object get osdf:///routeviews/chicago/route-views.chicago/bgpdata/2025.03/RIBS/rib.20250319.0400.bz2 ./
   ```
   
7. In the "Terminal" tab of your OSPool Notebook, paste and run the command you copied.
8. Run the command `ls -lh` to confirm the object was downloaded. For the RouteViews example, you should see something like this:

  ```
  (base) jovyan:~$ ls -lh
  total 73M
  -rw-r--r-- 1 jovyan users  73M May 30 20:35 rib.20250319.0400.bz2
  drwxr-sr-x 7 jovyan users  184 May 30 20:30 tutorial-fastqc
  drwxr-sr-x 8 jovyan users 4.0K May 30 20:30 tutorial-osdf-noaa
  drwxr-sr-x 9 jovyan users 4.0K May 30 20:30 tutorial-r-noaa
  drwsrwsr-x 1 jovyan users   60 May 30 20:30 work
  ```

**ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You've downloaded data using the Pelican Platform. ðŸŽ‰**

## What did you do? (An introduction to the Pelican Platform)

In practice, by following the above instructions, you:

1. Found a data repository available via the OSDF
2. Found the Pelican URL for that data repository
3. Downloaded the corresponding object using Pelican

We'll go into more detail on each of these points to give you an introduction to the Pelican Platform.

### Exploring the OSDF

The Open Science Data Federation (OSDF) is the flagship instance of the Pelican Platform and 
serves to connect the United State's scientific data repositories to computing infrastructure.
The OSDF itself originated from the need for large-scale data movement to support distributed high throughput computing systems like the OSPool.
This eventually gave rise to the Pelican Platform, a standalone software suite to run systems like the OSDF.

With the development of Pelican, it is now even easier to connect data repositories to the OSDF. 
The webpage you visited ([osg-htc.org/services/osdf/data](http://osg-htc.org/services/osdf/data)) lists the data repositories available via the OSDF,
representing an evergrowing list of "open science" communities.
Any US-based academic, government, or non-profit institution may connect their object store to the OSDF;
this includes non-public data, so long as it is not highly regulated or sensitive (such as PII or HIPAA data).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For more information on the OSDF, including next steps for connecting your open science data repository to the OSDF, 
> see [osg-htc.org/services/osdf](https://osg-htc.org/services/osdf).

Once a data repository is connected to the OSDF, its contents are easily accessible via the Pelican Clients that are the subject of this tutorial.\*
Every object accessible via the OSDF has a corresponding Pelican URL that exists within the single, overarching namespace of the OSDF.
This enables you, the user, to access any object in the OSDF by providing its Pelican URL, 
**without needing to know anything about the type of storage used to host the data**.
That is, the commands to interact with objects via Pelican are always the same, 
regardless of whether the data lives on POSIX, S3, or some other storage system!

\**This is technically true of any Pelican Federation; the OSDF is simply an established instance of such a Federation.*

### Anatomy of a Pelican URL

In the [Quickstart](#quickstart), the command you ran specified the location of the desired object using a Pelican URL.
The Pelican URL is a unique address to any object within the single namespace provided by a Pelican Federation.

There are four components to a Pelican URL:

* The "protocol"
* The "discovery URL"
* The "namespace prefix"
* The "object name"

These components are combined into a single string of the form

```html
<protocol>://<federation_URL>/<namespace_prefix>/<object_name>
```

By examining each of these components, we can build up an understanding of how Pelican is structured.

#### The protocol

In the same way that your browser uses the `https://` protocol to interact with a website, 
Pelican uses the `pelican://` protocol to interact with a Pelican Federation.
The `pelican://` protocol is built upon the HTTP protocol and extends it with a set of metadata lookups. 
Among other things, this means Pelican can leverage the ubiquitous internet infrastructure 
- any internet-capable device can theoretically use Pelican!

> [!NOTE]
> A motivated programmer who understands HTTP could develop their own Client to interact with a Pelican Federation,
> much in the same way that they could develop a custom browser to interact with an `https://` website!

#### The discovery URL

In the same way that a website is uniquely identified by its domain name, 
a Pelican Federation is uniquely identified by its discovery URL. 
To interact with a Pelican Federation, the Client needs to know the web service that it should connect to.

For example, the discovery URL for the OSDF is `osg-htc.org`, which behind-the-scenes corresponds to `https://osg-htc.org`.

> [!INFO]
> But `https://osg-htc.org` is already a website, so how does the OSDF work?
> The answer is that a website for a Pelican Federation needs to provide a specific webpage 
> that Pelican knows to look for, as part of the standards set by the `pelican://` protocol.
